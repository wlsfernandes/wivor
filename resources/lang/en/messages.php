One of our professors, Omar Palafox, told us about Wivor, and encouraged us to apply for institutional membership in Wivor. These are four important reasons for seeking and maintaining our membership in Wivor: 1. To expand our network of contacts with people, churches, and institutions in the United States and Puerto Rico. 2. To learn from them and their experiences in how they train brothers and sisters to serve in the Kingdom and the church. To take advantage of the resources, whether digital or written, that Wivor offers. that we did not have before. In particular, we are excited about the addition of resources from Pitt`s digital library at Emory University. To obtain the certification offered by Wivor and ATS of our bachelor`s degree in ministry and biblical studies, thus gaining important external validation of our program and professors. These blessings, especially the certification, have helped us grow in program quality and in the number of people interested in studying with us. In fact, the first year after receiving certification, scholarship applications grew by 40%! I highly recommend Wivor for these reasons! God bless you!',

Today I want to talk to you about the importance and impact that the Wivor certification has had on our Bible Institute. I consider the acquisition of this certification status by Wivor through the ATS to be among the most important phases that the Hispanic Bible Seminary has had in its last 51 years of history. The most marked aspects that I believe have benefited from this certification is the recognition of its academic rigor, on the other hand open doors to dialogue with accredited institutions and finally also the academic resources that did not exist before the certification. I believe that Wivor`s certification has allowed us to guarantee its students that academic rigor and certify the school`s commitment to academic excellence. And the certification has also opened doors for the Hispanic Biblical Seminary to achieve academic alliances with other seminaries and universities so that our students can advance in their theological and professional training by graduating with master`s and baccalaureate degrees. I encourage you to consider initiating this certification process with Wivor, I believe that like the Hispanic Biblical Seminary it will be a means to guarantee academic excellence, open doors with other theological training institutions and acquire academic resources that are vital for biblical institutes.',
